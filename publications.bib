   abstract = {EGFR mutation-induced drug resistance has significantly impaired the potency of small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors in lung cancer treatment. Computational approaches can provide powerful and efficient techniques in the investigation of drug resistance. In our work, the EGFR mutation feature is characterized by the energy components of binding free energy (concerning the mutant-inhibitor complex), and we combine it with specific personal features for 168 clinical subjects to construct a personalized drug resistance prediction model. The 3D structure of an EGFR mutant is computationally predicted from its protein sequence, after which the dynamics of the bound mutant-inhibitor complex is simulated via AMBER and the binding free energy of the complex is calculated based on the dynamics. The utilization of extreme learning machines and leave-one-out cross-validation promises a successful identification of resistant subjects with high accuracy. Overall, our study demonstrates advantages in the development of personalized medicine/therapy design and innovative drug discovery. N on-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has become a major threat to human health 1. Mutations, such as in-frame deletions or amino acid substitutions, clustered around the ATP-binding pockets of the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are the primary cause of NSCLC 1-3. In clinical treatment of NSCLC, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as gefitinib and erlotinib are widely used 3,4. These two reversible inhibitors show stronger binding affinity with mutant kinases than the wild-type (WT) EGFR, and they indeed produce good results for many patients for a period of time 2. However, the effectiveness of these inhibitors is limited by the emergence of drug resistance, sometimes due to a second mutation, such as the substitution of threonine with methionine at residue site 790 2,3. The cause of drug resistance is thought to be steric interference with the binding of inhibitors caused by the mutations 5-7. Irreversible inhibitors including CL387/785, EKB-569, and HKI-272 are proposed to tackle the problem 5,6,8-10. However, the EGFR structure will be chemically modified via a covalent bond 2 , which is not encouraged in practical therapy. Therefore, the EGFR mutation-induced drug resistance leads to an urgent demand to develop new treatment strategies 11,12. With the rapid development of bioinformatics, computational methods 13,14 have become more efficient and popular for studying the molecular mechanism of mutation-induced drug resistance, developing predictive tools, and designing resistance-evading drugs 4,11,12,15. These computational approaches are investigated based on the genotypic data, which fall into two categories: sequence-based and structure-based approaches. With the utilization of three-dimensional (3D) structural information 16 , machine learning and pattern classification methods such as neural networks 17-19 , support vector machines (SVM) 20 and decision trees 21 have shown high potential in the prediction of drug resistance and innovative drug design 11. In this paper, we present a method that combines the EGFR-inhibitor interaction pattern and the specific personal features for each of our 168 clinical subjects to construct a personalized drug resistance prediction model. Our method can have useful applications to the development of personalized medicine/therapy. In this method, mutations in protein sequences of the EGFR kinase domain are initially translated into the 3D structures based on a template structure, using protein structure prediction tools scap 22 and loopy 23. AMBER 24 is employed to simulate the dynamics of the kinase mutant-inhibitor systems and evaluate the binding free energies of the mutants and inhibitors. We then characterize the EGFR-inhibitor interaction by the energy components of the binding free energy extracted via MM/PBSA in AMBER 24. These interaction patterns coupled with specific personal features of our subjects are regarded as main characteristics for further classification.

   abstract = {EGFR mutation-induced drug resistance has become a major threat to the treatment of non-small-cell lung carcinoma. Essentially, the resistance mechanism involves modifications of the intracellular signaling pathways. In our work, we separately investigated the EGFR and ErbB-3 heterodimerization, regarded as the origin of intracellular signaling pathways. On one hand, we combined the molecular interaction in EGFR heterodimerization with that between the EGFR tyrosine kinase and its inhibitor. For 168 clinical subjects, we characterized their corresponding EGFR mutations using molecular interactions, with three potential dimerization partners (ErbB-2, IGF-1R and c-Met) of EGFR and two of its small molecule inhibitors (gefitinib and erlotinib). Based on molecular dynamics simulations and structural analysis, we modeled these mutant-partner or mutant-inhibitor interactions using binding free energy and its components. As a consequence, the mutant-partner interactions are amplified for mutants L858R and L858R-T790M, compared to the wild type EGFR. Mutant delL74-P753insS represents the largest difference between the mutant-IGF-1R interaction and the mutant-inhibitor interaction, which explains the shorter progression-free survival of an inhibitor to this mutant type. Besides, feature sets including different energy components were constructed, and efficient regression trees were applied to map these features to the progression-free survival of an inhibitor. On the other hand, we comparably examined the interactions between ErbB-3 and its partners (EGFR mutants, IGF-1R, ErbB-2 and c-Met). Compared to others, c-Met shows a remarkably-strong binding with ErbB-3, implying its significant role in regulating ErbB-3 signaling. Moreover, EGFR mutants corresponding to poor clinical outcomes, such as L858R-T790M, possess lower binding affinities with ErbB-3 than c-Met does. This may promote the communication between ErbB-3 and c-Met in these cancer cells. The analysis verified the important contribution of IGF-1R or c-Met in the drug resistance mechanism developed in lung cancer treatments, which may bring many benefits to specialized therapy design and innovative drug discovery.},

   abstract = {Background: Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation-induced drug resistance has caused great difficulties in the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, structural information is available for just a few EGFR mutants. In this study, we created an EGFR Mutant Structural Database (freely available at http://bcc.ee.cityu.edu.hk/data/EGFR.html ), including the 3D EGFR mutant structures and their corresponding binding free energies with two commonly used inhibitors (gefitinib and erlotinib). Results: We collected the information of 942 NSCLC patients belonging to 112 mutation types. These mutation types are divided into five groups (insertion, deletion, duplication, modification and substitution), and substitution accounts for 61.61% of the mutation types and 54.14% of all the patients. Among all the 942 patients, 388 cases experienced a mutation at residue site 858 with leucine replaced by arginine (L858R), making it the most common mutation type. Moreover, 36 (32.14%) mutation types occur at exon 19, and 419 (44.48%) patients carried a mutation at exon 21. In this study, we predicted the EGFR mutant structures using Rosetta with the collected mutation types. In addition, Amber was employed to refine the structures followed by calculating the binding free energies of mutant-drug complexes. Conclusions: The EGFR Mutant Structural Database provides resources of 3D structures and the binding affinity with inhibitors, which can be used by other researchers to study NSCLC further and by medical doctors as reference for NSCLC treatment.},

   abstract = {b EGFR-mutated non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has long been a research focus in lung cancer studies. Besides reversible tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), new-generation irreversible inhibitors, such as afatinib, embark on playing an important role in NSCLC treatment. To achieve an optimal application of these inhibitors, the correlation between the EGFR mutation status and the potency of such an inhibitor should be decoded. In this study, the correlation was profiled for afatinib, based on a cohort of patients with the EGFR-mutated NSCLC. Relying on extracted DNAs from the paraffin-embedded tumor samples, EGFR mutations were detected by direct sequencing. Progression-free survival (PFS) and the response level were recorded as study endpoints. These PFS and response values were analyzed and correlated to different mutation types, implying a higher potency of afatinib to classic activation mutations (L858R and deletion 19) and a lower one to T790M-related mutations. To further bridge the mutation status with afatinib-related response or PFS, we conducted a computational study to estimate the binding affinity in a mutant-afatinib system, based on molecular structural modeling and dynamics simulations. The derived binding affinities were well in accordance with the clinical response or PFS values. At last, these computational binding affinities were successfully mapped to the patient response or PFS according to linear models. Consequently, a detailed mutation-response or mutation-PFS profile was drafted for afatinib, implying the selective nature of afatinib to various EGFR mutants and further encouraging the design of specialized therapies or innovative drugs.},

   abstract = {Co-clustering, often called biclustering for two-dimensional data, has found many applications, such as gene expression data analysis and text mining. Nowadays, a variety of multidimensional arrays (tensors) frequently occur in data analysis tasks, and co-clustering techniques play a key role in dealing with such datasets. Co-clusters represent coherent patterns and exhibit important properties along all the modes. Development of robust coclustering techniques is important for the detection and analysis of these patterns. In this paper, a co-clustering method based on hyperplane detection in singular vector spaces (HDSVS) is proposed. Specifically in this method, higher-order singular value decomposition (HOSVD) transforms a tensor into a core part and a singular vector matrix along each mode, whose row vectors can be clustered by a linear grouping algorithm (LGA). Meanwhile, hyperplanar patterns are extracted and successfully supported the identification of multi-dimensional co-clusters. To validate HDSVS, a number of synthetic and biological tensors were adopted. The synthetic tensors attested a favorable performance of this algorithm on noisy or overlapped data. Experiments with gene expression data and lineage data of embryonic cells further verified the reliability of HDSVS to practical problems. Moreover, the detected co-clusters are well consistent with important genetic pathways and gene ontology annotations. Finally, a series of comparisons between HDSVS and state-of-the-art methods on synthetic tensors and a yeast gene expression tensor were implemented, verifying the robust and stable performance of our method.},

   abstract = {Critiques are employed as user feedback in critiquing-based recommender systems and they play an important role in the learning of user preferences, where recommender systems can gradually refine their understanding of user needs and provide better recommendations to users in subsequent interaction sessions. To reduce the effort of user interaction, the advantage of improving the recommendation efficiency by exploring relevant critiquing sessions in the interaction histories of other users has been recognized in recent studies of experience-based critiquing. In this study, we propose a novel approach for processing the historical interaction data in compound critiquing systems. In particular, we describe a history-aware collaborative compound critiquing method, which combines the strategies of preference-based compound critiquing generation and graph-based relevant session identification. Based on a simulation study using real-life data sets, we demonstrated that the proposed method outperformed other experience-based critiquing methods in terms of the recommendation efficiency. We also conducted a retrospective user evaluation, which confirmed the following observations: (1) incorporating user experience into compound critiquing systems significantly improves the performance compared with traditional unit critiquing systems; and (2) our graph-based session identification approach is superior to other baseline methods in terms of reducing the interaction effort of users.},

   abstract = {Background: High utilizers (HUs) are a small group of patients who impose a disproportionately high burden on the healthcare system due to their elevated resource use. Identification of persistent HUs is pertinent as interventions have not been effective due to regression to the mean in majority of patients. This study will use cost and utilization metrics to segment a hospital-based patient population into HU groups. Methods: The index visit for each adult patient to an Academic Medical Centre in Singapore during 2006 to 2012 was identified. Cost, length of stay (LOS) and number of specialist outpatient clinic (SOC) visits within 1 year following the index visit were extracted and aggregated. Patients were HUs if they exceeded the 90th percentile of any metric, and Non-HU otherwise. Seven different HU groups and a Non-HU group were constructed. The groups were described in terms of cost and utilization patterns, socio-demographic information, multi-morbidity scores and medical history. Logistic regression compared the groups' persistence as a HU in any group into the subsequent year, adjusting for socio-demographic information and diagnosis history. Results: A total of 388,162 patients above the age of 21 were included in the study. Cost-LOS-SOC HUs had the highest multi-morbidity and persistence into the second year. Common conditions among Cost-LOS and Cost-LOS-SOC HUs were cardiovascular disease, acute cerebrovascular disease and pneumonia, while most LOS and LOS-SOC HUs were diagnosed with at least one mental health condition. Regression analyses revealed that HUs across all groups were more likely to persist compared to Non-HUs, with stronger relationships seen in groups with high SOC utilization. Similar trends remained after further adjustment. Conclusion: HUs of healthcare services are a diverse group and can be further segmented into different subgroups based on cost and utilization patterns. Segmentation by these metrics revealed differences in socio-demographic characteristics, disease profile and persistence. Most HUs did not persist in their high utilization, and high SOC users should be prioritized for further longitudinal analyses. Segmentation will enable policy makers to better identify the diverse needs of patients, detect gaps in current care and focus their efforts in delivering care relevant and tailored to each segment.},

Methods: Data corresponding to 285,767 patients and 207,426 inpatient visits was extracted from electronic medical records of the National University of Hospital in Singapore between 2005 to 2013. Generalized linear models and generalized estimating equations were employed to build patient and inpatient visit models respectively. The patient models provide insight on the factors affecting overall expenditure and LOS, whereas the inpatient visit models provide insight on how expenditure and LOS accumulate longitudinally. Results: Although adjusted expenditure and LOS per inpatient visit were largely similar across socio-economic status (SES) groups, patients of lower SES groups accumulated greater expenditure and LOS over time due to more frequent visits. Admission to a ward class with greater government subsidies was associated with higher expenditure and LOS per inpatient visit. Inpatient death was also associated with higher expenditure per inpatient visit. Conditions that drove patient expenditure and LOS were largely similar, with mental illnesses affecting LOS to a larger extent. These observations on condition drivers largely held true at visit-level. Conclusions: The findings highlight the importance of distinguishing the drivers of patient expenditure and inpatient utilization at the patient-level from those at the visit-level. This allows better understanding of the drivers of healthcare utilization and how utilization accumulates longitudinally, important for health policy and service planning.},

   abstract = {Strengths and limitations of this study ► The study utilised a large longitudinal database of 9 years, allowing the development of a stable definition of PHUs. ► The prediction models developed contained features commonly available in most administrative databases , increasing applicability in other health systems. ► Internal validation using a wide range of hyperpa-rameters, as well as an additional round of external validation, ensured the robustness of the models selected. ► The PHU definition did not include patients with only high outpatient utilisation and no inpatient utilisa-tion, limiting generalisability of our findings to HUs with at least one inpatient admission. ► External validation of the final prediction model was carried out on an external data set which did not exclude patients who died and did not have poly-pharmacy score as a feature, resulting in findings which must be interpreted with caution. AbStrACt Objective We aim to characterise persistent high utilisers (PHUs) of healthcare services, and correspondingly, transient high utilisers (THUs) and non-high utilisers (non-HUs) for comparison, to facilitate stratifying HUs for targeted intervention. Subsequently we apply machine learning algorithms to predict which HUs will persist as PHUs, to inform future trials testing the effectiveness of interventions in reducing healthcare utilisation in PHUs. Design and setting This is a retrospective cohort study using administrative data from an Academic Medical Centre (AMC) in Singapore. Participants Patients who had at least one inpatient admission to the AMC between 2005 and 2013 were included in this study. HUs incurred Singapore Dollar 8150 or more within a year. PHUs were defined as HUs for three consecutive years, while THUs were HUs for 1 or 2 years. Non-HUs did not incur high healthcare costs at any point during the study period. Outcome measures PHU status at the end of the third year was the outcome of interest. Socio-demographic profiles, clinical complexity and utilisation metrics of each group were reported. Area under curve (AUC) was used to identify the best model to predict persistence. results PHUs were older and had higher comorbidity and mortality. Over the three observed years, PHUs' expenditure generally increased, while THUs and non-HUs' spending and inpatient utilisation decreased. The predictive model exhibited good performance during both internal (AUC: 83.2%, 95% CI: 82.2% to 84.2%) and external validation (AUC: 79.8%, 95% CI: 78.8% to 80.8%). Conclusions The HU population could be stratified into PHUs and THUs, with distinctly different utilisation trajectories. We developed a model that could predict at the end of 1 year, whether a patient in our population will continue to be a HU in the next 2 years. This knowledge would allow healthcare providers to target PHUs in our health system with interventions in a cost-effective manner.},

   abstract = {Accurately predicting protein-ligand binding affinities can substantially facilitate the drug discovery process, but it remains as a difficult problem. To tackle the challenge, many computational methods have been proposed. Among these methods, free energy-based simulations and machine learning-based scoring functions can potentially provide accurate predictions. In this paper, we review these two classes of methods, following a number of thermodynamic cycles for the free energy-based simulations and a feature-representation taxonomy for the machine learning-based scoring functions. More recent deep learning-based predictions, where a hierarchy of feature representations are generally extracted, are also reviewed. Strengths and weaknesses of the two classes of methods, coupled with future directions for improvements, are comparatively discussed.},

   abstract = {Background: Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and its signaling pathways play a vital role in pathogenesis of lung cancer. By disturbing EGFR signaling, mutations of EGFR may lead to progression of cancer or the emergence of resistance to EGFR-targeted drugs. Results: We investigated the correlation between EGFR mutations and EGFR-receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) crosstalk in the signaling network, in order to uncover the drug resistance mechanism induced by EGFR mutations. For several EGFR wild type (WT) or mutated proteins, we measured the EGFR-RTK interactions using several computational methods based on molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, including geometrical characterization of the interfaces and conventional estimation of free energy of binding. Geometrical properties, namely the matching rate of atomic solid angles in the interfaces and center-of-mass distances between interacting atoms, were extracted relying on Alpha Shape modeling. For a couple of RTK partners (c-Met, ErbB2 and IGF-1R), results have shown a looser EGFR-RTK crosstalk for the drug-sensitive EGFR mutant while a tighter crosstalk for the drug-resistant mutant. It guarantees the genotype-determined EGFR-RTK crosstalk, and further proposes a potential drug resistance mechanism by amplified EGFR-RTK crosstalk induced by EGFR mutations. Conclusions: This study will lead to a deeper understanding of EGFR mutation-induced drug resistance mechanisms and promote the design of innovative drugs.},

   abstract = {Motivation: Reliable predictive models of protein-ligand binding affinity are required in many areas of biomedical research. Accurate prediction based on current descriptors or molecular fingerprints (FPs) remains a challenge. We develop novel interaction FPs (IFPs) to encode protein-ligand interactions and use them to improve the prediction. Results: Proteo-chemometrics IFPs (PrtCmm IFPs) formed by combining extended connectivity fingerprints (ECFPs) with the proteo-chemometrics concept. Combining PrtCmm IFPs with machine-learning models led to efficient scoring models, which were validated on the PDBbind v2019 core set and CSAR-HiQ sets. The PrtCmm IFP Score outper-formed several other models in predicting protein-ligand binding affinities. Besides, conventional ECFPs were simplified to generate new IFPs, which provided consistent but faster predictions. The relationship between the base atom properties of ECFPs and the accuracy of predictions was also investigated. Availability: PrtCmm IFP has been implemented in the IFP Score Toolkit on github (https://github.com/debbydan wang/IFPscore).},

However , commonly-used data augmentation methods make con-trastive mechanism effect but may cause representation learning getting stuck in domain-specific information, which further deteriorates clustering performance and limits generalization ability. To this end, we propose a new framework , named Generalized Contrastive Clustering with domain shifts modeling (GeCC), which can integrate diverse domain knowledge to improve the clustering performance. Specifically, we first design a cluster-guided domain shifts modeling module to synthesize a reference view with diverse domain information. Then, we introduce instance representation and cluster assignment contrastive modules with well-designed attention weights to guide the representation learning and clustering. In this way, our method can maximize the extraction of cluster-related information and avoid over-fitting domain-specific features. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed method consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.},
