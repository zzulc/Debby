 abstract = {Contrastive clustering performs clustering and data representation in a unified model, where instance-and cluster-level constrastive learning are conducted simultaneously. However , commonly-used data augmentation methods make con-trastive mechanism effect but may cause representation learning getting stuck in domain-specific information, which further deteriorates clustering performance and limits generalization ability. To this end, we propose a new framework , named Generalized Contrastive Clustering with domain shifts modeling (GeCC), which can integrate diverse domain knowledge to improve the clustering performance. Specifically, we first design a cluster-guided domain shifts modeling module to synthesize a reference view with diverse domain information. Then, we introduce instance representation and cluster assignment contrastive modules with well-designed attention weights to guide the representation learning and clustering. In this way, our method can maximize the extraction of cluster-related information and avoid over-fitting domain-specific features. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed method consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.},
