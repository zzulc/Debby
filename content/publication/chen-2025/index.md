abstract: Contrastive clustering performs clustering and data representation in a
  unified model, where instance-and cluster-level constrastive learning are conducted
  simultaneously. However , commonly-used data augmentation methods make con-trastive
  mechanism effect but may cause representation learning getting stuck in domain-specific
  information, which further deteriorates clustering performance and limits generalization
  ability. To this end, we propose a new framework , named Generalized Contrastive
  Clustering with domain shifts modeling (GeCC), which can integrate diverse domain
  knowledge to improve the clustering performance. Specifically, we first design a
  cluster-guided domain shifts modeling module to synthesize a reference view with
  diverse domain information. Then, we introduce instance representation and cluster
  assignment contrastive modules with well-designed attention weights to guide the
  representation learning and clustering. In this way, our method can maximize the
  extraction of cluster-related information and avoid over-fitting domain-specific
  features. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed
  method consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.
