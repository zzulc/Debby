abstract: 'Critiques are employed as user feedback in critiquing-based recommender
  systems and they play an important role in the learning of user preferences, where
  recommender systems can gradually refine their understanding of user needs and provide
  better recommendations to users in subsequent interaction sessions. To reduce the
  effort of user interaction, the advantage of improving the recommendation efficiency
  by exploring relevant critiquing sessions in the interaction histories of other
  users has been recognized in recent studies of experience-based critiquing. In this
  study, we propose a novel approach for processing the historical interaction data
  in compound critiquing systems. In particular, we describe a history-aware collaborative
  compound critiquing method, which combines the strategies of preference-based compound
  critiquing generation and graph-based relevant session identification. Based on
  a simulation study using real-life data sets, we demonstrated that the proposed
  method outperformed other experience-based critiquing methods in terms of the recommendation
  efficiency. We also conducted a retrospective user evaluation, which confirmed the
  following observations: (1) incorporating user experience into compound critiquing
  systems significantly improves the performance compared with traditional unit critiquing
  systems; and (2) our graph-based session identification approach is superior to
  other baseline methods in terms of reducing the interaction effort of users.'
