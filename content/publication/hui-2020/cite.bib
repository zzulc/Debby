 abstract = {Strengths and limitations of this study ► The study utilised a large longitudinal database of 9 years, allowing the development of a stable definition of PHUs. ► The prediction models developed contained features commonly available in most administrative databases , increasing applicability in other health systems. ► Internal validation using a wide range of hyperpa-rameters, as well as an additional round of external validation, ensured the robustness of the models selected. ► The PHU definition did not include patients with only high outpatient utilisation and no inpatient utilisa-tion, limiting generalisability of our findings to HUs with at least one inpatient admission. ► External validation of the final prediction model was carried out on an external data set which did not exclude patients who died and did not have poly-pharmacy score as a feature, resulting in findings which must be interpreted with caution. AbStrACt Objective We aim to characterise persistent high utilisers (PHUs) of healthcare services, and correspondingly, transient high utilisers (THUs) and non-high utilisers (non-HUs) for comparison, to facilitate stratifying HUs for targeted intervention. Subsequently we apply machine learning algorithms to predict which HUs will persist as PHUs, to inform future trials testing the effectiveness of interventions in reducing healthcare utilisation in PHUs. Design and setting This is a retrospective cohort study using administrative data from an Academic Medical Centre (AMC) in Singapore. Participants Patients who had at least one inpatient admission to the AMC between 2005 and 2013 were included in this study. HUs incurred Singapore Dollar 8150 or more within a year. PHUs were defined as HUs for three consecutive years, while THUs were HUs for 1 or 2 years. Non-HUs did not incur high healthcare costs at any point during the study period. Outcome measures PHU status at the end of the third year was the outcome of interest. Socio-demographic profiles, clinical complexity and utilisation metrics of each group were reported. Area under curve (AUC) was used to identify the best model to predict persistence. results PHUs were older and had higher comorbidity and mortality. Over the three observed years, PHUs' expenditure generally increased, while THUs and non-HUs' spending and inpatient utilisation decreased. The predictive model exhibited good performance during both internal (AUC: 83.2%, 95% CI: 82.2% to 84.2%) and external validation (AUC: 79.8%, 95% CI: 78.8% to 80.8%). Conclusions The HU population could be stratified into PHUs and THUs, with distinctly different utilisation trajectories. We developed a model that could predict at the end of 1 year, whether a patient in our population will continue to be a HU in the next 2 years. This knowledge would allow healthcare providers to target PHUs in our health system with interventions in a cost-effective manner.},
