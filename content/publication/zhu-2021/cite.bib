 abstract = {Background: Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and its signaling pathways play a vital role in pathogenesis of lung cancer. By disturbing EGFR signaling, mutations of EGFR may lead to progression of cancer or the emergence of resistance to EGFR-targeted drugs. Results: We investigated the correlation between EGFR mutations and EGFR-receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) crosstalk in the signaling network, in order to uncover the drug resistance mechanism induced by EGFR mutations. For several EGFR wild type (WT) or mutated proteins, we measured the EGFR-RTK interactions using several computational methods based on molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, including geometrical characterization of the interfaces and conventional estimation of free energy of binding. Geometrical properties, namely the matching rate of atomic solid angles in the interfaces and center-of-mass distances between interacting atoms, were extracted relying on Alpha Shape modeling. For a couple of RTK partners (c-Met, ErbB2 and IGF-1R), results have shown a looser EGFR-RTK crosstalk for the drug-sensitive EGFR mutant while a tighter crosstalk for the drug-resistant mutant. It guarantees the genotype-determined EGFR-RTK crosstalk, and further proposes a potential drug resistance mechanism by amplified EGFR-RTK crosstalk induced by EGFR mutations. Conclusions: This study will lead to a deeper understanding of EGFR mutation-induced drug resistance mechanisms and promote the design of innovative drugs.},
