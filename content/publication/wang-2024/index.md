abstract: 'The launch of AlphaFold series has brought deep-learning techniques into
  the molecular structural science. As another crucial problem, structure-based prediction
  of protein-ligand binding affinity urgently calls for advanced computational techniques.
  Is deep learning ready to decode this problem? Here we review mainstream structure-based,
  deep-learning approaches for this problem, focusing on molecular representations,
  learning architectures and model interpretability. A model taxonomy has been generated.
  To compensate for the lack of valid comparisons among those models, we realized
  and evaluated representatives from a uniform basis, with the advantages and shortcomings
  discussed. This review will potentially benefit structure-based drug discovery and
  related areas. Graphical Abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.]'
