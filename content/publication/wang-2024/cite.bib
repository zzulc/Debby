 abstract = {The launch of AlphaFold series has brought deep-learning techniques into the molecular structural science. As another crucial problem, structure-based prediction of protein-ligand binding affinity urgently calls for advanced computational techniques. Is deep learning ready to decode this problem? Here we review mainstream structure-based, deep-learning approaches for this problem, focusing on molecular representations, learning architectures and model interpretability. A model taxonomy has been generated. To compensate for the lack of valid comparisons among those models, we realized and evaluated representatives from a uniform basis, with the advantages and shortcomings discussed. This review will potentially benefit structure-based drug discovery and related areas. Graphical Abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.]},
