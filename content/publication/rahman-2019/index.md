abstract: 'Background: As healthcare expenditure and utilization continue to rise,
  understanding key drivers of hospital expenditure and utilization is crucial in
  policy development and service planning. This study aims to investigate micro drivers
  of hospital expenditure and length of stay (LOS) in an Academic Medical Centre.
  Methods: Data corresponding to 285,767 patients and 207,426 inpatient visits was
  extracted from electronic medical records of the National University of Hospital
  in Singapore between 2005 to 2013. Generalized linear models and generalized estimating
  equations were employed to build patient and inpatient visit models respectively.
  The patient models provide insight on the factors affecting overall expenditure
  and LOS, whereas the inpatient visit models provide insight on how expenditure and
  LOS accumulate longitudinally. Results: Although adjusted expenditure and LOS per
  inpatient visit were largely similar across socio-economic status (SES) groups,
  patients of lower SES groups accumulated greater expenditure and LOS over time due
  to more frequent visits. Admission to a ward class with greater government subsidies
  was associated with higher expenditure and LOS per inpatient visit. Inpatient death
  was also associated with higher expenditure per inpatient visit. Conditions that
  drove patient expenditure and LOS were largely similar, with mental illnesses affecting
  LOS to a larger extent. These observations on condition drivers largely held true
  at visit-level. Conclusions: The findings highlight the importance of distinguishing
  the drivers of patient expenditure and inpatient utilization at the patient-level
  from those at the visit-level. This allows better understanding of the drivers of
  healthcare utilization and how utilization accumulates longitudinally, important
  for health policy and service planning.'
